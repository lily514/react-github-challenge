Code Challenge Instructions
We’d like you to complete an exercise that shows off your coding ability and your aptitude for learning new technical skills.     

Using the React JavaScript Library and GitHub APIs, we’d like to you to develop a simple standalone web application with the following features:     
* A view that performs a keyword search of repositories from GitHub and displays the results. 
  * Bonus: filtering and ordering 
* A view that lists the recent commits for any given repository. 
  * Bonus: A view that displays in a chart or graph the frequency of commits by contributor over the last seven days for any given repository.    

However you implement your code is completely up to you.

Please make your code available in a public GitHub repository and share the link with us in an email to mewu@purdue.edu by Thursday, June 28 at 4pm. Any commits after the allotted time will not be considered in your final evaluation.
